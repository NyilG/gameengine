-load a png as background picture, use image loader
-create a generic Background implementation (color, pic as bg)
-draw some static primitives in front of the background
-make primitives move, implement double buffering facility
-bind frame refresh to a key press event
-implement continue, pause, step functions
-create a generic start menu
-implement some basic collision detection
-load sounds as resources, bind them to game events

Resources:
all resources must have 
- a unique resource id
- state: UNLOADED, LOADED, MISSING
- type (IMAGE,SOUND,MUSIC) 

ResourceLoader is reading an input file describing resources to load.
At first, this is a simple property file with id=path format.
ResourceLoader is loading a resource on demand. Later this will be adjustable
to: 
- load a group of resources at start
- load resources on demand
- load a predefined group of resources on demand

Background:
- background with simple color
- background with an image
	- centered
	- tiled
	- stretched
